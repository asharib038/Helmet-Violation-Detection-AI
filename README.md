# Helmet-Violation-Detection-AI
\n archive.zip contains the Dataset on which the model is trained
\n The notebook.ipynb contains the complete code written on Google Colab Notebook
The extracted files from Dataset are uploaded to Google Drive and the Model is trained through synchorization with Drive
Dataset is also available at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pkdarabi/helmet
No any pre-trained model is used, Everything is done from scratch through implementing Convolutional Layers, Tensor Multiplication, Maxpooling and more
